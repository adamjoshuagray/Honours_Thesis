\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Historical Overview and Motivation}
\subsubsection{L'Hopital \& Liebniz}
Fractional calculus is almost as old as calculus itself. The 30th September 1695 is often cited as the the birthday of the field,
as it is the date on which Leibniz, in reply to L'Hopital's question about the operator $ \frac{d^\frac{1}{2}}{dx^\frac{1}{2}} $, 
wrote, ``It will lead to a paradox, from which one day useful consequences will be drawn.'' 
\subsubsection{Euler}
A crcuial function to almost all formulations of fractional calculus, is the gamma function, which extends the factorial function
to non-integer arguments. Although the problem of extending the factorial function had been considered by
Daniel Bernoulli and Christian Goldbach in the 1720's, it was eventually Euler who in a two letters, dated 13th October 1729 
and 8th January 1730 respectivly, gave two different representations of the factorial which could easily be extended
to non-integer values.
They were
\begin{align*}
	n! &= \prod_{k=1}^\infty \frac{\left( 1 + \frac{1}{k} \right)^n}{1 + \frac{n}{k}} \\
	\text{ and } \\
	n! &= \int_0^1 (-\ln s)^n ds 
\end{align*}
Euler made swift use of the gamma function
