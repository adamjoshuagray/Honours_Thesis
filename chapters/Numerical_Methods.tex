In this section we describe a variety of schemes for ariving at numerical solutions to fractional differential equations. To do this we will describe methods for the numerical approximation of fractional derivatives. We will also take a special look at at an Adams-Moulten-Bashford scheme and implementing in C# and in CUDA C/C++.

\sectopm{Approximations of Fractional Derivatives}

We first recall the Gr\"{u}nwald-Letnikov derivative of a function $ f $ is given by
$$
	(\mathcal{D}^{\alpha}f)(x) = \lim_{h \lra \infty} \frac{\Delta_h^\alpha f(x)}{h^\alpha}
$$
where
$$
	(\Delta_h^\alpha f)(x) = \sum_{0 \leq m < \infy} (-1)^m {\alpha \choose m} f(x +(q-m)h)
$$
