In this thesis I discuss many of the fundamental topics in the Field of Fractional Differential Equations. The point of this thesis is not to be extremely detailed in the handling of any particular part (although sometimes I am) but rather to give a good and broad account of the field of fracitonal differential equations. 

We start by looking at the history of fractional calculus, then define the operators which are fundamental to the field. In much the same way as ordinary differential equations have results about uniqueness and existance I go through similar results for ordinary fractional differential equations and extend some results. We also go through the analytic solutions to a small number of fractional differential equations before turning to numerical solutions. I go through a fractional Adam's Moulten Bashforth method and explain a multithreaded implementation both on the CPU and the GPU.
