In this thesis I discuss many of the fundamental topics in the field of fractional differential equations. The point of this thesis is not to be extremely detailed in the handling of any particular part (although sometimes I am) but rather to give a thorough and broad account of the field of fractional differential equations. 

I start by looking at the history of fractional calculus, then define the operators which are fundamental to the field. In much the same way as ordinary differential equations have results about uniqueness and existence I go through similar results for ordinary fractional differential equations and extend some results. I also go through the analytic solutions to a small number of fractional differential equations before turning to numerical solutions. I go through a fractional Adam's Moulton Bashforth method and explain a multi-threaded implementation on the CPU and a new implementation on the GPU. I also look at some of the functions which are key to fractional calculus and how one might go about numerically evaluating these functions. I finish on the topic of fractional diffusion which is a rapidly growing field. This particular topic is important as it serves to show that fractional calculus is in some sense \emph{not nonsense} and based in some physical reality.
