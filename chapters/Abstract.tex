In this thesis I discuss many of the fundamental topics in the field of fractional differential equations. 


I start by looking at the history of fractional calculus, then define the operators which are fundamental to the field. In much the same way as ordinary differential equations have results about uniqueness and existence I go through similar results for ordinary fractional differential equations and extend some results. I also go through the analytic solutions to a small number of fractional differential equations before turning to numerical solutions. I go through a fractional Adam's Moulton Bashforth method and explain a multi-threaded implementation on the CPU and a new implementation on the GPU.
