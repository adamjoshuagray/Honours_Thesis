\section*{Acknowledgements}

I have many people to thank, especially after so long at UNSW. I would like to thank all the people, both staff and students of the School of Mathematics and Statistics for their support, friendship and guidance throughout my degree. These are years that I will always remember and cherish as they have enriched me in ways I could never had imagined. 

I would like to specifically thank Dr Chris Tisdell for officially supervising me throughout my Honours year. Dr Chris Tisdell was one of my first lecturers in mathematics and he has been a formative influence on my mathematical view of the world. I would also like to thank Dr Chris Angstmann for his extensive comments, feedback and guidance on work I have been doing throughout the year. Without the talks I have had with him, my perspective on fractional calculus would be significantly narrower than it is today. I would also like to thank Dr Michael Hirschhorn and Dr Bill McLean for their assistance and feedback on a number of technical questions throughout the year.

I also must thank my colleagues for their kindness and understanding throughout the year. A special thanks must go to Ed McDonald for his mathematical assistance on countless problems throughout my degree. It is hard to overestimate how helpful Ed has been on so many occasions. 

Finally, I would like to thank my mother and father, because without them I almost certainly would not have had the opportunities I do today, and I would have not gone to University. I will remain eternally indebted to them for their sacrifices and my mother's unwaivering support and inspiration.
